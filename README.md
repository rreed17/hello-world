Hello People of the thrid planet from the glowing bright orb,

Thank you for checking on me and my many ventures that have always kept me and you within constent contact. Even through the most wild and wicked solution are compromised at most of the meetings, there is always a sense of dread once I walk down the four steps to the living area. I once shed a tear when I hit the bottom step but since you was waiting at the stoop I wiped away quickly. If that smile would had caught a glimps of the sadness, it would have faded and disappeared and I would not have that happend on this day!
